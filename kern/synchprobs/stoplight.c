 * You should implement your solution to the stoplight problem below. The
 * quadrant and direction mappings for reference: (although the problem is, of
 * course, stable under rotation)
 *
 *   |0 |
 * -     --
 *    01  1
 * 3  32
 * --    --
 *   | 2|
 *
 * As way to think about it, assuming cars drive on the right: a car entering
 * the intersection from direction X will enter intersection quadrant X first.
 * The semantics of the problem are that once a car enters any quadrant it has
 * to be somewhere in the intersection until it call leaveIntersection(),
 * which it should call while in the final quadrant.
 *
 * As an example, let's say a car approaches the intersection and needs to
 * pass through quadrants 0, 3 and 2. Once you call inQuadrant(0), the car is
 * considered in quadrant 0 until you call inQuadrant(3). After you call
 * inQuadrant(2), the car is considered in quadrant 2 until you call
 * leaveIntersection().
 *
 * You will probably want to write some helper functions to assist with the
 * mappings. Modular arithmetic can help, e.g. a car passing straight through
 * the intersection entering from direction X will leave to direction (X + 2)
 * % 4 and pass through quadrants X and (X + 3) % 4.  Boo-yah.
 *
 * Your solutions below should call the inQuadrant() and leaveIntersection()
 * functions in synchprobs.c to record their progress.
